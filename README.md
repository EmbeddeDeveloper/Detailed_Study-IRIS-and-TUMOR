# Detailed-Study-IRIS
Detailed study of various Classification and Clustering Algorithms

The Datasets used in this repository are 
1. IRIS - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris 
2. TUMOR - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original)

The Excel Sheet "Project Dataset.xlsx " is provided with the notebooks and can be downloaded.

## IRIS
### Data Set Information:

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

### Predicted attribute:
class of iris plant. 


## TUMOR
### Data Set Information:

Samples arrive periodically as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases. The database therefore reflects this chronological grouping of the data. This grouping information appears immediately below, having been removed from the data itself: 

Group 1: 367 instances (January 1989) <b>
Group 2: 70 instances (October 1989) <b>
Group 3: 31 instances (February 1990) <b>
Group 4: 17 instances (April 1990) <b>
Group 5: 48 instances (August 1990) <b>
Group 6: 49 instances (Updated January 1991)<b> 
Group 7: 31 instances (June 1991) <b>
Group 8: 86 instances (November 1991)<b> 
----------------------------------------- 
Total: 699 points (as of the donated datbase on 15 July 1992) 

### Predicted Attribute:
Tumor Nature: Benign - malignant
